I'm a software engineer currently working at Deloitte in the department of Artificial Intelligence and Data, and I'm also a researcher at INESC-ID.

My current research interests are data science, human-centered systems, and artificial intelligence.

I completed the MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon. During my time at the Instituto Superior Técnico, I worked as Teaching Assistant in the computer science department and Research Assistant on two projects where I focused on data analytics and visualization techniques.


<!-- My hobbies include I'm currently collaborating with the [Adamastor Project](https://projectoadamastor.org/) that aims to bring free public domain ebooks to more people. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
