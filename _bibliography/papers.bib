  title={On Usable Security and Verified Password Managers}, 
  author={Carreira, Carolina}, 
  abstract={Password Managers (PMs) are useful tools to manage passwords but they are not widely used. Studies indicate usability problems and distrust from users as the reasons for the low adoption of PMs.
    As such, we propose extending an existing PM by implementing relevant usability best practices and increasing transparency by educating users about how PMs work.
    This project is part of the PassCert research project, which aims to build a formally verified PM. Therefore, another goal is to explore ways that effectively convey to users the formally verified properties.
    We performed user studies that suggest that our solution improves the usability of the PM and that we were able to convey relevant information about its formally verified features. We contribute with the first study on users' perceptions of formal verification on PMs and hope that our findings can help the formal verification security community  better communicate with end-users. },

  abstract={As software becomes more complex and assumes an even greater role in our lives, formal verification is set to become the gold standard in securing software systems into the future, since it can guarantee the absence of errors and entire classes of attack. Recent advances in formal verification are being used to secure everything from unmanned drones to the internet. At the same time, the usable security research community has made huge progress in improving the usability of security products and end-users comprehension of security issues. However, there have been no human-centered studies focused on the impact of formal verification on the use and adoption of formally verified software products. We propose a research agenda to fill this gap and to contribute with the first collection of studies on people's mental models on formal verification and associated security and privacy guarantees and threats. The proposed research has the potential to increase the adoption of more secure products and it can be directly used by the security and formal methods communities to create more effective and secure software tools.},

  title={Towards Improving the Usability of Password Managers},
  author={Carreira, Carolina and Ferreira, Jo{\~a}o F and Mendes, Alexandra},
  journal={INFORUM},
  year={2021},
  abstract={Security experts strongly recommend the use of Password
    Managers (PMs). However, PMs are not widely used and studies indi-
    cate usability problems and distrust from users as the reasons for their
    low adoption. In this paper, we review usability challenges of PMs and
    we propose the use of known usability best practices and techniques to
    extend and improve Bitwarden, a widely-popular open-source PM. Since
    this work is done in the context of the PassCert project, which aims
    to build a formally verified PM, we also investigate ways to effectively
    convey to users the formally verified properties. We report on prelim-
    inary results and we propose a methodology to evaluate our extension
    of Bitwarden and to determine the impact of formal verification on the
    adoption of PMs.},
